# **Drag-and-Drop Website Builder**  

## **Overview**  
This is a **drag-and-drop website builder** built using **React, React DnD, and Tailwind CSS**. It allows users to visually create a webpage by dragging elements (text, images, buttons) into a predefined structure. Users can also edit element properties after placement.  

## **Features**  
âœ… **Drag and Drop** â€“ Move elements from a sidebar to the canvas  
âœ… **Editable Elements** â€“ Modify text, images, and buttons after placing them  
âœ… **Responsive UI** â€“ Designed with Tailwind CSS for a modern and mobile-friendly layout  
âœ… **Easy to Extend** â€“ Modular components for adding more elements in the future
